## üöÄ Overview

**Quick Tabs** is a **cross-platform utility** written in **Rust** designed to simplify opening numerous URLs simultaneously. It can quickly detect installed browsers on your system or even a mounted system and launch multiple links concurrently in a single, dedicated window.

### Key Features

* **Broad Browser Detection:** Detects and supports a wide range of browsers, including **Chrome, Brave, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Chromium**, and more.
* **Default Browser Check:** Automatically identifies the system's default browser.
* **Single Window Launch:** Opens all URLs in **one browser window (currently limited to private/incognito mode).**
* **Cross-Platform:** Full support for **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.
* **Input File:** Reads URLs easily from a user-defined `links.txt` file.
* **Performance:** Utilizes parallel checks for **fast browser detection**.
* **Configuration Output:** Saves detected browser paths to a `browsers.txt` file for easy reference.

    git clone https://github.com/Rakllan/Quick_Tabs.git
    cd Quick_Tabs
    ```

2.  **Build the Project**

## üíª Usage

To use Quick Tabs, you need a list of URLs, and then you simply run the executable.

1.  **Prepare Your Links**
    Create a file named **`links.txt`** in the root directory of the project. Each URL must be on its own line.

    ```text
    # links.txt example
    [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com)
    [https://github.com/Rakllan/Quick_Tabs](https://github.com/Rakllan/Quick_Tabs)
    [https://doc.rust-lang.org/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
    ```

2.  **Run the Utility**
    Execute the compiled binary (`open_private`) using Cargo.

    ```bash
    cargo run --bin open_private
    ```

    The program will first detect your installed browsers. It will then prompt you to select a browser and open all the links from `links.txt` in a single **private/incognito window** of your choice.
